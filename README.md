## Wirefames
## Mockups
None, I learned an important lesson with my last project and wanted to go strictly MVP. I also wanted to utilize Materialize for this project, so I just styled using their classes and made modifications using Styled-Components. 
## ERDs
## Technologies:
* Node
* Express
* Mongo
* Mongoose
* React
* Materialize CSS
* Styled-Components
* Axios
* Sketch
## Version 2
* I would create high fidelity mockups and use Styled-Components to code those designs. 
* I would add custom icons to the radio buttons
* Add functionality that would display a default cheese picture if the user did not imput a cheese image link
